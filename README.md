AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  
This program reproduces a simplified version of the board game Scrabble.
This program was made for the SYSC 3110 team project, by group 8, which consists of Khalid Merai, Scharara Islam, Marina Latif and Saad Eid.

RULES OF SCRABBLE 

Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares.

The game is played by two to four players on a square game board imprinted with a 15×15 grid of cells (individually known as "squares"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile.
In an English-language set, the game contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English. Commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values.

The letter values of the tiles are added up, and tiles placed on Double Letter Score (DLS) and Triple Letter Score (TLS) squares are doubled or tripled in value, respectively. Tiles placed on Double Word Score (DWS) or Triple Word Score (TWS) squares double or triple the value of the word(s) that include those tiles, respectively. In particular, the center square (H8) is considered a DWS, and the first play is doubled in value.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM FOR SUBMISSION 1:
1. Download a junit.framework package to ensure all test methods run and the whole code implementation runs. Can be downloaded from this link https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:junit%20AND%20a:junit
2. If user does not have a junit tester and does not want to dowloand it just remove or bypass the SquareTest.java and TileTest.java it by putting it in /** */
3. Dowloand the whole src and open it on intelij then configure the project then run the program by running class scrabble.java.
